# Proposal Form
If you'd like to make a commission proposal, please copy these questions into your message and answer each. This will let me know we're on the same page and will let me get an estimate back to you sooner. If you're unsure about what a question is asking, you can instead respond to that question with what you'd like clarified, and I can do so in my response message.

### Disclaimers
- Have you read the pricing rationale and estimates on the commissions website?
- Do you accept the payment and refund policies as described on the commissions website?
- Have you read the disclaimers regarding availability, polish, and long-term support under the "What NOT to Expect" section of the commissions website?

### Hardware Limitations
- Is 3D printing an appropriate medium for making your controller's case?
- Does your planned layout have 25 or fewer buttons?
- Does your planned layout require any analog inputs (e.g. analog sticks, knobs, trackpads)?
- Does your use-case require wireless connectivity?

### Preferences
- What keyboard switches would you like to use? If you don't have an exact switch in mind, please describe your preferences (light vs. heavy, smooth vs. tactile vs. clicky, silent, etc.) so we can find something that works.
- What keycaps would you like to use? If you don't have exact caps in mind, please describe your preferences (circle vs. square, keyboard vs. arcade button size, 3D printed or professionally manufactured, etc.) so we can find something that works.
- What colors would you like?
- What is your planned use-case?
- Would you like any cables (e.g. USB-C to Gamecube) included?

### Initial Reference
Once you've answered the above questions, please include any reference material for what you'd like to base your controller on. This can include pictures of other controllers, drawings, or descriptions of what you have in mind. Consider looking through the DIY Gallery in [Crane's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/S3qgZWD) if you need some inspiration.
