											<h2>What is This?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Leverless controllers, sometimes also called digital, box, or rectangle controllers depending on the context, are flat, all-digital controllers designed for input-intensive 2D games like fighting games and platformers. They mimick the reliability and snappiness of a mechanical keyboard, but with more versatility in their input handling and more granular ergonomics. The controllers I make are 3D printed and use standard mechanical keyboard switches to maximize customizability and reliability at a reasonable price and scale.</p>
										<p>As a competitive Melee player, Hollow Knight speedrunner, ergonomic keyboard enthusiast, and CAD/electronics hobbyist, making custom controllers for comfortable and accurate gameplay has become an important and fulfilling hobby of mine. Now that I've gained some experience making controllers for myself and friends, I've decided to open commissions for anyone interested in using a controller like mine.</p>

									<h2>What to Expect</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<h3>Pricing</h3>
										<p>I'll be as transparent as possible with the justifications for my pricing, including a full parts list and estimated completion time for each step of the process. The specifics of your build will directly influence the price, but for a ballpark estimate, expect to pay at least $200USD for a more basic controller with all parts included, and around $300USD+ for a fully custom shell with fancier components.</p>
										<p>Payment is expected after initial discussions and prior to modelling/building, and refunds will be issued if requested prior to the build starting or after if I'm unable to complete it. Refunds cannot be issued after the controller is built.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Customization</h3>
										<p>There are some hardware limitations discussed in the proposal form. Beyond this though, controllers are almost entirely customizable. Button layouts can match existing designs or be made completely from scratch. Case color, size, and shape are up to your preference, as are the switches and keycaps used. Multi-material 3D printing can be used to customize your case further with emblems or other patterns. If you'd like to be able to switch things out, we can make the controller hot-swappable for easy switch replacement. And, thanks to the Haybox firmware, you'll be able to control the default behavior and input types (eg Gamecube Controller, keyboard, XBox controller, etc.) of your controller to suit your use-case</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Development</h3>
										<p>Once you've got some details in mind, you can <a href="#second">get in contact with me</a> and fill out the <a href="https://github.com/Lep19/commissions/blob/main/proposal-form.md">proposal form</a>. Once we've agreed on a price and rough outline, I'll get to work mocking up layouts for you to test and model the controller's case around it as you've specified. I'll do some test prints to ensure everything fits as expected, then final prints, and finally hand wire the components inside the case. Throughout the whole development process, I'll send progress photos and comments so you can fine-tune dimensions and appearances.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<header class="major">
									<h2>What NOT to Expect</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<h3>Constant Availability</h3>
										<p>As mentioned, I'm a hobbyist, not a manufacturing business with a customer support branch. I also work and go to school, and my availibility will be limited accordingly. You're welcome to reach out at any time with questions about progress and potential changes, and I'll do my best to respond within 24 hours. Additionally, in the event that I have multiple requests at once, I will work on them in order. You may need to wait if there are others ahead of you.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Professional Polish</h3>
										<p>Though I will model and position prints with ideal surface finishes in mind, I do not post-process my prints beyond basic cleanup. This means no sanding or painting. Additionally, the firmware is community-made and may be challenging to interface with. I'll do my best to set everything up before sending it to you, and I can provide some support for minor changes if necessary.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Long-Term Repairs</h3>
										<p>With the exception of defective components or parts breaking shortly after arrival, I don't offer repairs or replacements. I'll be sure to test all buttons, input modes, and extra features before shipping. In extenuating circumstances, I'll do my best to make things right with partial or full refunds depending on the severity and immediacy of the issue.</p>
